* Support partial block read and write accesses.
* Support changing the password of existing encrypted drives.
* Support filling the device with random data on creation.
* Add possibility to back up and restore the volume header (both, standard,
  and hidden).
* Allow file system creation (FAT (via mkdos), and BFS (via mkbfs)).
* Allow drive detection on something other than the device ID; ie. one could
  save the (encrypted) volume header, and compare that with existing devices.
* Get rid of the global driver lock for I/O.
* Have a nice icon for DriveEncryption.
